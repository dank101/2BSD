There are 2 skeletal makefiles: makefile.v6 which I made from
the local makefile.CORY, and makefile.v7 which I made from makefile.VAX.

If you wish to change pathnames or some such, then look at ex_tune.h.
Conditional compilation flags:
	-DTRACE		for debugging (wont then fit on an 11)
	-DV6		for version 6, using raw (v7 uses cbreak)
	-DCHDIR		compile in undocumented old chdir (cd) command
	-DLISP		compile in lisp hacks
	-DUCVISUAL	compile in code to handle \ escapes for visual on
			upper case only terminals.  gross.

Ex means to avoid stdio like the plague, only needing a printf which
prints through putchar and thus needs doprnt.s from the library.
SOMEONE AT SOME POINT REVERSED THE ORDER OF THE ARGS TO STROUT SO BE
SURE THAT THE 11PRINTF.C ORDER IS CORRECT.  IF NOT USE PRINTF.C.

Ex is very large, but should fit (barely) on an 11/70.  If there isn't at
least 1K bytes of text space left you have dragged in something which isnt
necessary.  You should not be dragging in stdio.  Look at the tail of
a "nm -ng" to see what is going on if this happens.
